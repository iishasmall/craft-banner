# craft-banner
banner done with the yoman banner generator creator - https://github.com/johnfmorton/generator-buildabanner

This banner was done with the Yeoman banner generator Please read the README_YEOMAN_INFO.MD to see how to run.

Download the banner generator here - https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-buildabanner

Basic usage

You may install this Yeoman workflow through npm.

npm install -g generator-buildabanner

the final banner is in the "dist" folder 

You may also link this workflow locally into your own NPM installation using npm link when you are in the generator-buildabanner directory from within your terminal.

To get started use yo buildabanner and answer the prompts.

gulp commands
gulp : This is the most basic command. It will spin up a server in your 'dev' folder. It will compile your SCSS into CSS. It will also watch for changes in the index.html, scripts.js and style.scss files and reload Google Chrome.

gulp check : This command is useful to check for some basic consistency in your banner. It will confirm that the metadata ad.size matches the size of your backup image. It also checks to see if you have a single image in the backImage directory.

gulp build : This command will create a 'dist' folder and fill it with minified versions of your files. It will also compress these same files into a zip file in the 'delivery' folder. NOTE: If you've used files starting with "comp", like "comp1.png" or "comp2.jpg", which can be used for positioning elements in your banner, they will not be included in your 'dist' folder. This is important to know if you happen to have a file called "competition.jpg" in your banner build because it will excluded.

gulp archive : This command will create an 'archive' folder and a single zip file that contains the contents of your dev, dist and delivery directories plus your package.json, gulpfile.js and your Sublime Text project file. These are the necessary files to archive your banner once it is finished. (Your node_modules directory can be recreated later with npm install.)

gulp ba : This is a shortcut for running check, build, archive in sequence.

gulp help : Will provide info on the available comands.

About offline usage
The workflow offers to download a copy of the Greensock library for off-line use. Since Greensock is offered via npm, it will be placed in the 'node_modules' folder.

Working on a DoubleClick banner requires that you have an Internet connection to load the Enabler.js. The workflow offers to download a copy of the Enabler.js. If you choose to do this, it places a copy of Enabler.js in a folder called "offline". (This option is only present if you choose to build a DoubleClick banner.)

Both of these prompts for offline use default to "yes". The downloaded code is not referenced in the HTML though. You will need to manually update the HTML to load them. I've included the download of these files because I sometimes find that I need to work on these projects when having a stable Internet connection isn't possible. Having the files downloaded into my project is a failsafe for those situations.

Roadmap
Below are some goal posts for the future of this workflow.

I may add an option to automatically include the downloaded Greensock files into the HTML by doing something like gulp --offline. I'm still deciding the approach I want to take for this though. So far, the CDN has worked best for me.
Additional media vendor templates may be added in the future but the workflow now includes all the basis ones we generally use. Suggestions welcomed though.
Tips
Be sure to check out the gulp check command. If you make resizes by duplicating a bannerâ€™s folder the metadata ad.size value is easy to overlook and this will help you catch that error. That's what prompted the creation of that command.
